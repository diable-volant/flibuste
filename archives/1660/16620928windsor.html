Ses instructions portent qu'il doit tenter de négocier un droit de commerce avec les Espagnols, et si ces négociations échouent, il est autorisé à armer les flibustiers. Les pourparlers avec les Espagnols aboutissent rapidement à une impasse, et Windsor autorise les armements des flibustiers, brièvement interrompus à son arrivée à la Jamaïque. Il délivre donc des commissions pour prendre sur les Espagnols, autorisation dont le présent document donne un exemple, et il confie le commandement en chef des flibustiers au capitaine Christopher Myngs, officier de la Royal Navy, pour aller attaquer Santiago de Cuba, ville réputée pour l'assistance qu'elle a donnée à la résistance espagnole qui s'était organisée à la côte nord de la Jamaïque, après la conqu&ecirc;te de l'île par les Anglais. George Brimacain, porteur de la présente commission, fut l'un des capitaines de Myngs dans <A HREF="16621029myngs.html">cette entreprise, qui fut couronnée de succès</A>. Si l'on compare la commission de Brimacaim à d'autres (voir notamment <A HREF="16690728ogeron.html">celle délivrée au capitaine Trébutor par le gouverneur de la Tortue</A>), l'on notera qu'elle est particulièrement longue et détaillée, et que, par souci de contrôler les excès bien connus des flibustiers, elle est assortie d'instructions bien précises, que devait respecter son porteur.</P><P CLASS="signum"><STRONG>R.
