Ses instructions portent qu'il doit tenter de n&eacute;gocier un droit de commerce avec les Espagnols, et si ces n&eacute;gociations &eacute;chouent, il est autoris&eacute; &agrave; armer les flibustiers. Les pourparlers avec les Espagnols aboutissent rapidement &agrave; une impasse, et Windsor autorise les armements des flibustiers, bri&egrave;vement interrompus &agrave; son arriv&eacute;e &agrave; la Jama&iuml;que. Il d&eacute;livre donc des commissions pour prendre sur les Espagnols, autorisation dont le pr&eacute;sent document donne un exemple, et il confie le commandement en chef des flibustiers au capitaine Christopher Myngs, officier de la Royal Navy, pour aller attaquer Santiago de Cuba, ville r&eacute;put&eacute;e pour l'assistance qu'elle a donn&eacute;e &agrave; la r&eacute;sistance espagnole qui s'&eacute;tait organis&eacute;e &agrave; la c&ocirc;te nord de la Jama&iuml;que, apr&egrave;s la conqu&ecirc;te de l'&icirc;le par les Anglais. George Brimacain, porteur de la pr&eacute;sente commission, fut l'un des capitaines de Myngs dans <A HREF="16621029myngs.html">cette entreprise, qui fut couronn&eacute;e de succ&egrave;s</A>. Si l'on compare la commission de Brimacaim &agrave; d'autres (voir notamment <A HREF="16690728ogeron.html">celle d&eacute;livr&eacute;e au capitaine Tr&eacute;butor par le gouverneur de la Tortue</A>), l'on notera qu'elle est particuli&egrave;rement longue et d&eacute;taill&eacute;e, et que, par souci de contr&ocirc;ler les exc&egrave;s bien connus des flibustiers, elle est assortie d'instructions bien pr&eacute;cises, que devait respecter son porteur.</P><P CLASS="signum"><STRONG>Le Diable Volant</STRONG>.</P></DIV>					<!-- DOCUMENT --><H3>document 620928w</H3><DIV CLASS="earchive"><DIV CLASS="source"><B>description :</B> commission et instructions de Thomas, Lord Windsor (gouverneur de la Jama&iuml;que) &agrave;
